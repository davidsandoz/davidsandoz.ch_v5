I was born on December 26, 1989 in [Neuchâtel](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuch%C3%A2tel), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland). I did my whole schooling in [La Chaux-de-Fonds](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Chaux-de-Fonds), from kindergarten to the high school at the [Lycée Blaise-Cendrars](http://www.lyceeblaisecendrars.ch). Then I studied at the **[Swiss Institute of Technology Lausanne](https://epfl.ch)** (EPFL), where I accomplished a Master degree in [Computer Science](http://ic.epfl.ch/computer-science). Currently, I am a **Software Engineer** at [Nothing Interactive](https://nothing.ch).

Since **July 19, 2008** my heart beat for **[Caroline González](http://twitter.com/carogonzo)** with whom I live a fabulous story!

I'm involved a lot in [tchoukball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tchoukball) in Switzerland. After playing for five years at the [Tchoukball Club La Chaux-de-Fonds](http://www.tbcc.ch), my studies at [<abbr title="École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne">EPFL</abbr>](http://www.epfl.ch) made me change club. I then played at the [Nyon Tchoukball Club](http://www.ntbc.ch) for six years. In September 2015, as I started working at [Nothing Interactive](https://nothing.ch), I joined the [Tchoukball Club Bern](http://tcbern.ch). I am also a [J+S tchoukball instructor](http://www.jugendundsport.ch/internet/js/fr/home/sportarten/tchoukball/uebersicht.html) and an Executive at [Swiss Tchoukball](http://www.tchoukball.ch). I have been a player in the Swiss team from 2007 to 2010.


**Amateur photographer**, I try my hand at sports photography, mainly tchoukball. You'll find my pictures on [my Flickr account](https://flickr.com/siedler), but also on [the one from Swiss Tchoukball](https://flickr.com/swisstchoukball). For a selection of my best shots, see you on my [500px account](https://500px.com/davidsandoz). From time to time, I also post on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/davidsandoz) where I force myself to share only photographs taken with my iPhone.
