I was born on December 26, 1989 in [Neuchâtel](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuch%C3%A2tel), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland). I did my whole schooling in [La Chaux-de-Fonds](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Chaux-de-Fonds), until high school at the [Lycée Blaise-Cendrars](http://www.lyceeblaisecendrars.ch). Then I studied at the **[Swiss Institute of Technology Lausanne](https://epfl.ch)** (EPFL), where I accomplished a Master degree in [Computer Science](http://ic.epfl.ch/computer-science). Currently, I am a **Software Engineer** at [Nothing Interactive](https://nothing.ch) in [Wabern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabern_bei_Bern).

Since July 19, 2008, my heart beats for **[Caroline González](http://twitter.com/carogonzo)** with whom I live a fabulous story!

I'm involved a lot in [tchoukball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tchoukball) in Switzerland. After playing for five years at the [Tchoukball Club La Chaux-de-Fonds](http://www.tbcc.ch), my studies at [Swiss Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL)](http://www.epfl.ch) made me change club. I then played at the [Nyon Tchoukball Club](http://www.ntbc.ch) for six years. In September 2015, as I started working at [Nothing Interactive](https://nothing.ch), I joined the [Tchoukball Club Bern](http://tcbern.ch). In September 2018, I am welcomed in the [Lausanne Tchoukball Club](http://ltbc.ch) as I moved in the area. I am also a member of the [Swiss Tchoukball](http://www.tchoukball.ch) Executive Committee and have been a player in the Swiss national squad from 2007 to 2010.


**Amateur photographer**, I try my hand at sports photography, mainly tchoukball. You'll find my pictures on [my Flickr account](https://flickr.com/siedler), but also on [the one from Swiss Tchoukball](https://flickr.com/swisstchoukball). For a selection of my best shots, see you on my [500px account](https://500px.com/davidsandoz). From time to time, I also post on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/davidsandoz) where I force myself to share only photographs taken with my iPhone.
